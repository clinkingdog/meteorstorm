# meteorstorm

Just a "quick" meteor test project.

Oh but I haven't got git initialised in the right place, have I? It doesn't include the vagrant files. So I can't do a full zero-to-hero here. FFS.

So far I think the lesson is if you're running Windows, don't use Meteor yet. Wait till they support it properly. (Longer version: Currently it requires using Vagrant, with some extra mystery magic setup steps, and even then you can only run git from within your VM, not from your host machine, so you have to configure a git setup all over again, and, and, and I JUST WANT TO MAKE MY APP GODDAMMIT.)
