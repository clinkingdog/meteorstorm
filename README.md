# meteorstorm

Just a "quick" meteor test project.

Ok so I _think_ the setup procedure is now:
* Install Meteor for Windows (currently only a preview version, but should be good enough): https://github.com/meteor/meteor/wiki/Preview-of-Meteor-on-Windows
* Git clone this repository
* cd into the directory and run meteor - or maybe you need to "meteor create" first and then replace with the git clone? Or maybe you need to git commit the .meteor files? Not quite sure.
